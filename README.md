# ISGDA Overview
- We created an inductive, supervised method of rare disease diagnosis using knowledge-enhanced learning.
- This method is based on the phenotype ontology (Upheno).
- It is a ranking approach that produces scores for gene-disease associations. Therefore, for our query 'D', 'G' is ranked. 

# Dependencies
- The code uses the mOWL library (requires JAVA and JDK installed)
- Python version: 3.10.16
- mOWL version: 1.0.1
- PyKEEN version: 1.11.0
- Class Resolver version: 0.5.4
